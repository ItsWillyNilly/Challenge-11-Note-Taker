# Note Taker Starter Code
This is a Note Taker application that utilizes Express.js, uiniqid node module, File System(fs) node module, path node module, and databases.

## Description
I was tasked with adding code to existing code. Specifically, I needed to create a server.js file that utilizes express.js to bridge together the front and back end of the application. Server.js contains middleware along with get, delete, and post requests for adding and modifying data in the database.

## User Story

```
